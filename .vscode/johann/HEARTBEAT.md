# Heartbeat Checklist

> Johann reads this file during periodic heartbeat polls.
> Add items here for Johann to check on regularly.
> Mark items done or remove them when no longer needed.

## Recurring Checks
- [ ] Review recent daily notes and distill into MEMORY.md
- [ ] Check for any TODO items in the codebase
- [ ] Review SOUL.md — does it still reflect who I am?

## One-Time Reminders
- [ ] Add a `Johann: Configure Models` command that jumps directly to Johann model settings.
- [ ] Improve orchestration cancellation/stall errors to include cancellation reason and stalled subtask IDs in user-facing output.
